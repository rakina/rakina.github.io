    	<h2>Work stuff</h2>
    	<h3>Browser engineering @ Google Chrome (2017 - now)</h3>
    	<div>
    		I joined Google's Chrome team as a Software Engineer straight out of undergrad in 2017,
	    	and became a Senior Software Engineer in 2020.<br>
	    	I love working on Chrome and the web platform, and have contributed to multiple areas, from the rendering pipeline to the navigation architecture to cross-browser web platform standardization.<br>
		    One of the greatest part about working on an open source browser and the web platform is I can talk about most of it anywhere I want to!<br>
		   	So, here are some selected highlights: (<b>Note: you can click the TL;DRs to expand/close details</b>, thanks to the magic of HTML):</br>
	    </div>
	    <ul>
    		<li>
	    		<h3>Navigation & Security Architecture (2020 - now)</h3>
		    	<details>
		    		<summary><b>TL;DR: Making Chrome's navigation architecture simpler and more secure!</b></summary>
		    		<ul>
		    			<li>
		    				Navigation is what happens when you instruct Chrome to go to a webpage, through clicking links, updating the adress bar, etc.<br>
		    				It feels simple, but see this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFIvyc1y1ws"> great Chrome University video</a> on how many things are involved in navigation!
		    			</li>
		    			<li>
		    				I am <b>one of the owners of the navigation code</b>
		    				(<a target="_blank" href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:content/browser/renderer_host/OWNERS;l=19;drc=eace61a13d7b5c145076e2bd92cfbe8fbff6253b">content/browser/renderer_host</a>)
		    				in Chromium.<br>
		    				As a member of the Chrome Security Architecture team, I also often guide engineers and teams needing help with navigation.<br>
		    				If you are changing code in that area, please feel free to send the CL to me, or ask questions to navigation-dev@chromium.org!
		    			</li>
		    			<li>
		    				I have been working on <b>reducing the dependency of Chrome's browser process on the untrusted renderer process on navigations</b>.<br>

		    				Back/Forward Cache exists in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, and <b>we want BFCache's interaction with web pages to be interoperable.</b> <br>
		    				Also, most existing web platform features used to not define what happens to them when a webpage using them is cached,<br>
		    				lowering the hit rate or even causing undefined behavior. We are actively fixing those specifications.<br>
		    				I've also <b>updated <a target="_blank" href="https://w3ctag.github.io/design-principles/#support-non-fully-active">W3C's Design Principles doc to add BFCache considerations</a></b>,

	    <div>
	    	When I was an undergrad in University of Indonesia (2013 - 2017), I tried multiple internships and part-time jobs:

	    		</li>
	    	</ul>
	    	If you are a CS student interested in doing software engineering internships but don't know how to even start, I felt the same way a couple years ago too!<br>
	    	So, I wrote a <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.rakina.fyi/2016/12/09/frequently-asked-questions-about-internships/">hopefully-still-relevant guide</a> on how to approach it.<br>

	        <li>
	        	My favorite things recently are:
	        	<ul>
	        		<li>Studying security stuff, to be better at my job :)</li>
	        		<li>Snowboarding - I started in Winter 2020 and quickly fell in love with it (after hating it for a bit :) )</li>
	        		<li>Scuba Diving - I have the SSI Open Water & Advanced Adventurer certification, and eager to learn more!</li>
	        		<li>
	        			Traveling - When it was a thing. Pre-2020, I used to do a lot of business travel to conferences and Google offices, and often do personal trips after.<br>

	        		</li>
	        		<li>Learning 日本語 to survive - I passed JLPT N3 (Intermediate) in 2018, and have been working towards JLPT N2 (Advanced) ever since (got lazy :) )</li>
	        		<li>Trying out new hobbies: Thanks to COVID, I've tried various things to varying degrees of success:
	        			<ul>
	        				<li>Stand-up paddleboarding - Great, but I need to live near a large body of water...</li>
	        				<li>Surfing - SUP was a better experience, but eager to try again :)</li>
	        				<li>Gardening - harvested lots of tomatoes before my neighbor complained and I stopped :(</li>

	        	</ul>
	        </li>
	        <li>
	        	I learned how to code when I was 13, had my first internship in San Francisco when I was 18,<br>
	        	then moved to Tokyo when I was 20 to start my full time job at Google after graduating from university.<br>
	        	In a previous life, I was an annoying teenager that based my whole personality on liking computer science,
		        especially <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming">competitive programming</a>,
		        despite not being the greatest at it :)<br>
		        Some selected highlights from that time period: <br>
		        <ul>
		        	<li>
		        		My team (Awrakin - best name ever!) qualified for and competed in the <a target="_blank" href="https://icpc.global/community/results-2017">ACM ICPC World Finals in 2017</a>.
		        		We didn't win it, but it was fun!
		        	</li>
		        	<li>
		        		I got the <a target="_blank" href="https://toki.id/hall-of-fame-apio/">highest bronze medal in the Asia Pacific Informatics Olympiad</a> (2013).
		        		I was literally 1 point away from Silver and still a bit salty years later.
		        	</li>
		        	<li>
		        		I got a gold medal in Indonesia's National Science Olympiad in Informatics (2012).<br>
		        		I then attended the TOKI training camps for the International Olympiad of Informatics and got to the penultimate stage (top 8 students).<br>
		        		I loved the experience so much, and voluntereed to be part of the TOKI scientific committee for the 2014-2015 period!
		        	</li>
		        	<li>
		        		I won a bunch of national programming contests in high school and undergrad.<br>
		        	 	The most important part is that those unknowingly helped me practice for SWE Internship interviews before I know they were a thing :)
